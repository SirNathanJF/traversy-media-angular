## Questions

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at [Github](https://github.com/SirNathanJF) or through email at <nathanflessner@gmail.com>. If you would like to use my source code please fork the repository. Locally you will need to ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` and use ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```. ```ng serve``` also works. Please note that in order to display the tasks to the page you will need to also run ```npm run server``` to start the local "API". Enjoy!
